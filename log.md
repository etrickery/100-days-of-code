# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: June 1st, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started the process over

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am going 2000 different directions, but getting somewhere. Teaching myself Kotlin.

**Link to work:** My Kotlin repository. It has not much of anything in it. 



### Day 1: June 2nd, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for codewars and spent several hours there. Realized I am SOOOO rusty at Java, and there is a ton of stuff I don't know that are common programming things. 

**Thoughts**: I got stuck on a bug in a program, where string.charAt(x) would produce one result, and a variable (variable = string.charAt(x) would give the value 51. So is 51 the meaning of life or something? WTF... anyway, still haven't figured it out but 3 hours in, I got to get back to work.

**Link(s) to work**: none
